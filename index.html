      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Diwakar. I like building things. I like analysing and visualising data. Recently I have started to like frontend and web development. <br>
        I like lots of things, sometimes too many. But it is fun that way. <br>
        When I'm not coding, I am playing basketball, working out so I can be better at basketball, watching basketball...or playing videogames and watching anime. <br>

        <h3>There are a lot of things I want to do, but here are some things I have already done</h3>
        <li>
          <h3>Discord Bot, DeKay</h3>
          <p>This is a discord bot I have been working on recently for personal use for my friends and I. I used the discordJS module for development. 
          Dekay's main purpose is to play music, or specifically audio from youtube videos and the user can queue up multiple songs to play in sequence, additionally the user can pause and stop the music whenever they like through interactable buttons.
          It also has some other amusing features like sending insulting GIFs which makes my friends laugh.  <br> 
          It has been awesome to work on this as usually nobody gets to use the stuff I build, so seeing my friends use it motivates me to work on it and improve it. It is my first time developing in NodeJS and I have been enjoying learning more about asynchronous programming and promises. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 >Query Engine</h3>
          <p>For a group project I worked on the backend of a query engine in TypeScript. I implemented functionality relating to parsing different files(HTML and JSON) containing data on university courses and buildings and storing relevant information locally so they could be queried. 
          Testing was done via MochaJS and I was responsible for constructing a comprehensive testing suite covering different use cases. We used Github for version control and collaboration and followed Agile methodologies throughout, having weekly scrum meetings and code reviews to improve our workflow. </p>

         <li>
          <h3 >Calorie Tracker</h3>
          <p>A calorie tracker written in Java for tracking your calories and macros throughout the day. It has a functioning GUI, memory persistence to save and load your caloric intake for a certain day, and the ability to set a calorie limit. One of my earliest projects but one I am still proud of, and I made it in order to help myself eat healthier so I can achieve my fitness goals. </p>
